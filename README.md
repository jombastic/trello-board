# Trello-Like Task Management Application

This project is a task management web application, inspired by Trello, built using Nuxt3.js and TypeScript. It offers an interactive interface for managing tasks, which can be organized into various columns such as "Backlog", "Selected for Dev", "In Progress", "QA", and "Complete".

## Key Features

* **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:** Enabled by the vuedraggable library, users can easily move tasks between different columns.
* **Task Management:** Each task, displayed as a draggable card with its title and creation date, can be created, deleted, and moved across columns.
* **Task Creation:** Users can create new tasks through an expandable text area. On pressing "Enter" or "Tab", a new task is created with a unique ID (generated by the nanoid library) and the current date as the creation date.
* **Persistent State:** The application's state, including the columns and their tasks, is stored in local storage, ensuring persistence across browser sessions.
